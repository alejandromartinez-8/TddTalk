In this file i will explain the proccess that we will continue in the Demo. The idea is to show the different approaches of London School 
and Chicago School to work with TDD and know the differences between the ways to generate Tests and code.
We will start with London School and then we will show Chicago School approach.
1 - We write empty tests that we think we need.
2 - Write the code of the tests.
3 - Write the code to pass the tests.
4 - Refactor if it is necessary to get better code.
5 - The tests will continue pass after refactor.
6 - Go to bottom layer and repeat the same steps from 1 to five.

For Chicago we can repeat the same steps of London but starting from the bottom layer. The idea of the TDD is the same starting from test 
and then write the code but the difference is the entry point and the way to think the test that you will need.
